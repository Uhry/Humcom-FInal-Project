    <p id="about">   The first secondary school in Baguio was the normal school in 1916 later called Baguio Trade School. Classes were held where Home Sweet Home now stands as this area and the present University of the Philippines Baguio location was included in the reserved land for the Bureau of Education by Forbes. In 1919 it became Mountain Province High School. Classes were held at Teacher’s Camp and native girls from all over the province were housed at Bua Dormitory known today as Pacdal Elementary School. 
        Among the pioneer teachers were Juan Balagot, Servillano Tumaneng, Pedro Balagot, Genoveva Llamas, Esperanza Ver, Donato Guerzon, Julia Guerzon, Grace H. Miller, Petra Ramirez, and Pilar Tan and Jess L. Gains who was also the principal.<br><br>

MPHS easily gained national popularity in both academics and athletics because for a number of years, it had the strongest baseball team in Northern Luzon. Its coach, Arthur McCann produced baseball champs such as pitcher Antonio Capulo who one time pitched a non score game to Northern Luzon Teams and Juan Cerantes who was rated best 2nd baseman in the country.
 Antonio Dimas, Eugene Pucay, Gilbert Sonduan, Dibson Diwas, Braulio Caoili and Chakchakan Colis became legends in their time. The girls were famous for their extensive lace making and native weaving projects that easily became popular among tourists. The graduates added to the institution’s prestige for they had high proficiency in both spoken and written English.<br>

Succeeding principals who served MPHS were Mr. Richard B. Patterson, Ms. Eldridge, and Mr. Paul Bramlett.<br>

The normal curriculum was transferred to the Trinidad Agricultural High School; thus, it became the responsibility of the Mountain Province. <br><br>

In 1937, the national government transferred the financial responsibility of maintaining the school to the city government; thus, the name Mountain Province High School was replaced with Baguio City High School. BCHS squatted at the present site of Baguio Government Center until World War II broke out in 1941. During the Japanese occupation, classes were held at Quezon Elementary School. By 1945, the school admitted students at the Vallejo Hotel, then moved back to Teacher’s Camp during the second semester.<br>

The destruction of the Government Center buildings during the liberation started the school’s troubles about where to hold classes without having to move property and equipment. Several mayors worked for a permanent site of BCHS building. In 1947, Mayor Jose M. Cariño was eyeing the former residence of Governor Blanco. It didn’t push through however because of the plan to put up a national stadium and swimming pool at the Athletic Bowl site. Finally, Mayor Luis Torres succeeded in establishing the fact that former Governor Blanco’s place was the property of the government. Mayor Gil R. Mallare made every effort that led to the approval of the site as permanent house of BCHS. He also secured an amount of Php180, 000.00 loan from the Rehabilitation Financing Corporation to start the construction of the building on September 20, 1953.
