<h1 class="hymn">Baguio City High Hymn</h1>
  <p class="hymn1">
In all the world aye,
There’ll be but one highland home fondest to me.<br>
Baguio City fairest by far,
And but one Alma Mater, Baguio City High.<br>
However lowly, however lofty,
Fickle fate may lead me away,
Always remembrance will bring me back
To dear Baguio City High.<br>
In sunshine ‘neath clouds,
‘midst towering pine, colorful bouquets abloom,
Our loved campus greenward spread out,
Loveliest in all the land, Baguio City High.<br>
Today we sing, fore’er see visions,
Ah, the years shall tell our story
We shall not break faith we pledge thee,
Oh dear Baguio City High. </p>
            
 <h1 class="hymn"> Baguio City Hymn</h1>
          <p class="hymn1">
Oh, Baguio haven for all people
For you we thank the Lord and God of all
Pine sifted sunshine air we breathe so fresh
Tranquil beauty and invigorating breeze<br>
Your countless wonders known afar and near
Your verdant hills of kissed by clouds of pearl<br>
Myriad flowers bloom so beautiful in you
Like children of every land and hue<br>
For any race whether dark or light
None can resist your great invite<br>
To love and live in you forever
Our Eden dreams and gifts of the Creator
            </p>
  <h1 class="hymn">Cordillera Hymn</h1> 

  <p class="hymn1">Cradled by majestic mountains
Blessed with nature’s flowing fountains<br>
Blooming flowers and verdant hills
Is a region of murm’ring rills<br>
Chorus:<br>
Cordillera, region of wonder hail
Beloved land your name we shall not fail<br>
Honor and fame, to you we strive to bring
Your glory won, we shall forever sing<br>

Here dwell freedom-loving people
Strong our bond it’s hard to topple<br>
For our freedom we rise and fight
Our priceless ancestral birthright<br>

‘Neath the sky the rain may gather
Angry clouds may craz’ly wander<br>
But the sun shines forever fair
As we climb up the golden stair.<br>

Dreams of peace of oneness and progress
Cherished goals our regions’ praises<br>
Striving to build a brighter dawn
For our children to call their own.</p>
